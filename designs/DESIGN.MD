## üìñ Overview  

This folder contains two important schematic files related to the design of the Robotic Arm project. Each schematic serves a specific purpose and is crucial for the development and integration of the power electronics and embedded systems.

## üìÇ Schematic Files

### üîå 1. Power Electronics Schematic 

- **File Name**: [Schematic_Power-Drive-Controlled-Robotic-Arm_2025-01-13.pdf](Schematic_Power-Drive-Controlled-Robotic-Arm_2025-01-13.pdf)
- **Description**: This schematic implements the power drive for the robotic arm, including the configuration for servos and motors. It outlines how power is managed and distributed to ensure optimal performance of the robotic arm's movements.

### üñêÔ∏è 2. Embedded System Schematic 

- **File Name**: [Schematic_Glove-Motion-Controlled-Robotic-Arm_2025-01-13.pdf](Schematic_Glove-Motion-Controlled-Robotic-Arm_2025-01-13.pdf)
- **Description**: This schematic details the data acquisition part of the robotic arm, which captures user gestures through a glove interface. It is designed to facilitate communication between the user's gestures and the robotic arm's movements.

## üîß Key Components 

Both schematics utilize an **ESP32** microcontroller for control and communication purposes, enabling seamless integration between the power electronics and embedded systems.
