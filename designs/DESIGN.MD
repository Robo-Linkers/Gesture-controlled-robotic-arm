## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Note

You can implement the electronics in two ways:

- **Custom PCB**:  
  Build a dedicated PCB by referring to the provided schematics for a more compact and reliable design.

  You can design the PCB using free tools such as:
  - [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) ‚Äî Open-source, highly customizable PCB design software.
  - [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) ‚Äî Browser-based and beginner-friendly PCB design platform.

  > **Note**: Both tools are free to use (with some limitations).    
  After completing your design, export the files in **Gerber format** and submit them to a PCB fabrication vendor for manufacturing.

- **Perfboard / Breadboard**:  
  Alternatively, for prototyping or quick builds, you can assemble the circuits manually on a perfboard by carefully following the schematic connections. 
  Using a perfboard is recommended if manufacturing a custom PCB is not feasible or practical.


> **Note**: Ensure proper wire management and soldering practices if you choose the perfboard method to maintain signal integrity and minimize errors.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Power Safety Warning**  
> 
> The Power Drive system is designed to operate using a **12V DC SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supply)** rated at a minimum of **2.5A**.  
> 
> Please exercise extreme caution while handling the power system:
> - Ensure the SMPS is properly rated and from a reputable manufacturer.
> - Always verify polarity before connecting the supply to the circuit.
> - Never work on the circuit while the SMPS is powered ON.
> - Use appropriate fuses or protection circuits if possible.
> 
> üî• Mishandling the power supply can cause **serious damage to components** or **pose a fire hazard**.  
> Double-check all connections before powering the system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Wiring Instructions
- Ensure the all components are upto the rating as mentioned in the [BOM](Bill_of_Materials_Electrical.pdf)
- Make sure the pinout of your component matches the one provided in the schematic
- If a perfboard based design if being followed ensure that each voltage levels have different rails (think of it as a path for the current), the ground can occupy a single common rail.
-  [üîå 1. Power Electronics Schematic ](#-1-power-electronics-schematic) ‚Äî 
   -  ESP32-WROOM32:
         - GPIO Pins to control servos via PCA9685.
         - SDA (GPIO21) ‚Üí SDA of PCA9685
         - SCL (GPIO22) ‚Üí SCL of PCA9685 

   - PCA 9685
      - Set the buck converter(LM2596) to output a steady voltage of 5.5V
      - The servos are connected to channel 0,1 and 2

   - DRV8825 (Stepper Motor Driver):  
       - DIR (Direction) and STEP pins connected to GPIOs of ESP32 for motor control.
       - Enable pin if required can be connected to a GPIO pin

- [üñêÔ∏è 2. Embedded System Schematic ](#Ô∏è-2-embedded-system-schematic) ‚Äî
  - MPU6050 IMUs:
    - SDA (GPIO21) and SCL (GPIO22) for I2C communication.
    - One of the MPU6050 IMU has its ADD pin (pin no 7) pulled high to _+3.3V_ this so that both the MPU sensors have unique I2C addresses.

  - Flex Sensors and TTP223 Touch Sensors:
    - Flex sensors and touch sensors connected to the ESP32 analog or digital inputs based on your design.

### üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Instructions

- Begin assembly from the **base** to the **end effector**.
- Secure each joint firmly using M3 bolts and lock nuts.
- Align servos at their neutral (90¬∞) or zero position (0¬∞) position before fixing.
- Use threadlock on critical load-bearing screws.
- Maintain consistent spacing and ensure no binding during motion.
- For the base, use weight balancing if necessary (placing a metal plate or any apporpriate weights).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Mechanical Handling Notes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
>  
> - Avoid over-tightening bolts to prevent cracking plastic or aluminum parts.
> - Always test free movement manually before powering the arm.
> - Use washers where necessary to distribute load stress.
> - Use lubricant for ball bearings if necessary.
- Feature Exclusion: The integration of a 4th link between the end effector and the robotic arm, which would provide enhanced dexterity and range of motion, has not been implemented in this version of the design. This feature is part of our future plans and will be incorporated in a subsequent update to further improve the system's functionality.

#### Image of the Feature Excluded:
- The servo will be placed in the final design but wont be utilised for movement. _The feature has been circled in green_
![Image of Feature Excluded](../assets/images/feature-excluded.png)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** **3D Printing Tolerance Issues:** Significant tolerance issues were encountered during the 3D printing and mechanical assembly of the robotic arm. Misalignments, incorrect fits, and dimensional inaccuracies affected the integration of multiple components. It is **strongly recommended** to carefully inspect, measure, and, if necessary, modify the 3D models before printing. Pay special attention to part interfaces, mounting holes, and moving joints to ensure a smooth assembly and functional operation.
