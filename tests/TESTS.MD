## 📂 Folder Structure

The `tests` folder is organized into two main categories:

-   **Embedded Systems**: Contains tests related to embedded systems projects.

    -   `COMPLETE`: Contains a completed embedded systems project.
    -   `DUAL-MPU6050`: Contains tests for a dual MPU6050 sensor setup.
    -   `FLEX-SENSORS`: Contains tests for flex sensors.

-   **Power Electronics**: Contains tests related to power electronics projects.

    -   `complete`: Contains a complete power electronics project.
    -   `complete-dynamic`: Contains tests for a complete dynamic power electronics system.
    -   `nema_17_test`: Contains tests for NEMA 17 stepper motors.
    -   `servo_test`: Contains tests for servo motors.

## ⚙️ Usage

Each subfolder contains an `.ino` file, which can be opened and run using the Arduino IDE. Follow these steps to run the tests:

1.  Open the desired `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2.  Connect the appropriate hardware components to your Arduino board.
3.  Upload the code to the Arduino board.
4.  Monitor the output and verify the results.
